    "    - Enhancers\n",
    "- Listen to the lecture of Mike Levine on [enhancers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfgze3BItDY) (10'). You will learn about:\n",
    "    - Drosophila embryo development\n",
    "    - Visualization of gene expression\n",
    "    - What are enhancers and how they can be use to regulate specific gene expression patterns during development\n",
