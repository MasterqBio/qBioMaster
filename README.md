*At the  crossroads of Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Informatics, qbio is the  master program destined for students interested in studying Biology with a quantitative perspective founded on transdisciplinary approaches.*

# Introduction to qbio

[TOC] 

## Organisation

1st semester - 5 ECTS - 40 hours in the class. 

The majority of classes will not be "standard" lectures. Interaction will be privileged, and the attendants should prepare the class before the frontal lecture (see link column in the table below).



### Timetable

#### Instructors

[AA= Andrea Apolloni (CIRAD); EM = Emmanuel Margeat ; LC = Luca Ciandrini; LCo = Luca Costa ; MN = Marcelo Nolan; PEM = Pierre-Emmanuel Milhiet; SC = Sandra Cortijo (BPMP / SupAgro); JN = Jérémie Naud (IGF)]


#### Rooms
The course will take place in two different rooms at the CBS: The *seminar room* (1st floor, CBS29) and the *QuB* (to be pronounced 'cube', which is the Algeco just outside the main entrance of the CBS29).

Slots are usually 1.5h long.
