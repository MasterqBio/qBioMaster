*At the  crossroads of Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Informatics, qbio is the  master program destined for students interested in studying Biology with a quantitative perspective founded on transdisciplinary approaches.*

# Introduction to qbio

[TOC] 

## Organisation

1st semester - 5 ECTS - 40 hours in the class. 

The majority of classes will not be "standard" lectures. Interaction will be privileged, and the attendants should prepare the class before the frontal lecture (see link column in the table below).



### Timetable

#### Instructors

[AA= Andrea Apolloni (CIRAD); EM = Emmanuel Margeat ; LC = Luca Ciandrini; LCo = Luca Costa ; MN = Marcelo Nolan; PEM = Pierre-Emmanuel Milhiet; SC = Sandra Cortijo (BPMP / SupAgro); JN = Jérémie Naud (IGF)]


#### Rooms
The course will take place in two different rooms at the CBS: The *seminar room* (1st floor, CBS29) and the *QuB* (to be pronounced 'cube', which is the Algeco just outside the main entrance of the CBS29).

Slots are usually 1.5h long.

### Evaluation

Evaluation by projects (compulsory 5*20%). Students will have to return 5 compulsory homework projects - assignments, no other exam is planned.

#### Assignments 

Assignments given by LC should be sent to him by email (.ipynb file plus other needed material in case) by the deadline. Returning the homework with a delay will bring you a penalty.

When you send the assignment by email, please use the subject `Assignment X - Intro qbio` (where `X`is the number of the assignment); name the file as `AX_NameSurname.ipynb` and put all the necessary files (datasets, images,...) in a directory named `data`. Then zip the files and send the archive. For instance, when Luca sends the assignment 3, he will name the file `A3_LucaCiandrini.ipynb`, put all data in the folder `data`, compress everything in a single file to be sent in a message with subject `Assignment 3 - Intro qbio`.
